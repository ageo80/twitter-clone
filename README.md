Twitter Clone
=============

A simple clone of Twitter built as a CodeIgniter experiment. This project was created for learning purposes only, therefore use in production is not recommended.

Frameworks Used:
-------------
PHP  - [CodeIgniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter)
CSS - [Pure](http://purecss.io/)

Installation Instructions:
-------------
1. Run the SQL in the createtables.sql file inside the SQL Queries folder.
2. Open the application/config/database.php file and enter your database information.
3. Open the application/config/config.php file and define $config['encryption_key'] as a random String of characters.
4. Upload all files and folders to your server except for the ReadMe files, the license file, and the SQL Queries folder.
5. Finished! Navigate your browser to your server and you should see the homepage.

Hosted Instance
-------------
A hosted instance of this application is [available here](http://zipper.jrmiller.co/). Please note that the application is incomplete, so there is no guarantee anything will work. Please do not enter any real information into the application, as your data is not guaranteed to be secure (although it should be pretty secure).

Notes
-----
This application is no longer in development. It was created over the course of two weeks in order to learn CodeIgniter. [A post about the experience is available on my blog](http://blog.jrmiller.co/project-1-codeigniter).

This application is in no way complete. In particular, error and success messages are not present for many actions.
